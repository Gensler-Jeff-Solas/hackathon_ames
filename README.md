# Gensler Hackathon One!

Welcome to Gensler Hackathon One! This friendly competition serves as an opportunity for folks to show off their analytical skills and collaborate with other analysts across the company.

## Dataset

The dataset for this hackathon is the Ames Housing Dataset! Compiled by Dean De Cock in 2011, this dataset features the `salePrice` and 79 other explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The objective of this hackathon will be two-fold:

1) An exploratory analysis of the `train` dataset.
    - Teams will work to discover as many insights about the distribution of variables within the dataset, and relationship those variables have to one another; particularly, the extent to which those variables can be used to predict `SalePrice`. Your team will prepare a document or other deliverable which clearly and consisely explains your most meaningful insights.

2) Predicting `SalePrice` for the `test` data.
    - The dataset has been split into a `train` collection and a `test` collection. For the `test` collection, the `SalePrice` has been hidden. Your team will produce a prediction of price for each `test` entry.

This dataset was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashanknecrothapa/ames-housing-dataset), and then split into a `train` and `test` set for this hackathon. (Do not cheat by downloading the entire dataset from there!)

According to the site:
<blockquote>
The Ames Housing Dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It contains various features and attributes of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, USA. The dataset is often used for regression tasks, particularly for predicting housing prices.

Here are some key details about the Ames Housing Dataset:

- Number of Instances: The dataset consists of 2,930 instances or observations.
- Number of Features: There are 79 different features or variables that describe various aspects of the residential properties.
- Target Variable: The target variable in the dataset is the "SalePrice," representing the sale price of the houses.
- Data Types: The features include both numerical and categorical variables, covering a wide range of aspects such as lot size, number of rooms, location, construction, and more.
- The Ames Housing Dataset is widely used in the machine learning community for tasks such as regression modeling, feature engineering, and predictive analytics related to housing prices. It serves as a valuable resource for developing and testing machine learning algorithms and techniques in the real estate domain.

Interested in Data Science competitions? Kaggle hosts them all the time, challenging Data Scientists to build all kinds of models, particularly by using deep learning techniques to predict values or classifications from limited input data. They even have have [an ongoing competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) centered around this dataset

## Judging Criteria

### Project Framework & Teamwork

- How well was your team able to leverage the unique strengths of its members?
- What tools and processes did you use to communicate and share work?
- How easily would your team be able to incorporate new data into your analysis?

### Analysis

- What analytics tools and techniques were used in exploring the data?
- What insights were discovered from the data?
- How well did your team predict the SalePrice for the `test` set?

### Presentation of Findings

- What did your team produce to communicate your findings?
- How clear and convincing would your insights be to an audience unfamiliar with your methods?
- How easily would another team be able to reproduce your results based on your Presentation of Findings?

## Questions for getting started:
- What are the minimum and maximum `salePrice` values in the `train` dataset?
- How can categorical variables be analyzed alongside numerical variables?
- What should be done about variables which contain missing values for many entries?
- Which variables are most highly related to `salePrice`?

# Good luck!
